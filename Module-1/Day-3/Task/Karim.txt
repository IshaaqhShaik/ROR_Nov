Git:
    It is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open source Version Control System used to handle small to very large project
    effectively.

    Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non linear development.

Difference between Git and GitHub:
    *Git is a version control system that lets us manage and keep track of your source code history.
    *GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that lets us manage Git repositories.
    If we have open source projects that use Git then GitHub is designed to help us better manage them.

Git Life Cycle:
Step1: 
    First we clone any of the code residing in the remote repository to make our own local repository.
Step2:
    We edit the files that we have cloned in our local repository and make the necessary changes in it.
Step3:
    We commit our changes by first adding them to our staging area and committing them with a commit message.
Step4 and Step5:
    First we check whether there are any of the changes done in the remote repository by some other user's and  we first pull that 
    changes. If there are no changes we directly proceed with Step6 in which we push our changes to the remote repository and we are done with
    our work.

Git Three Stage Architecture:
    when a directory is made a Git repository, there are mainly 3 stages/states which make the essence of Git Version Control System. The
    3 states are 
        .Working directory
        .Staging area
        .Git Directory
