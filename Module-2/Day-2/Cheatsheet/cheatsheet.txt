Q 1.Differentiate between local variables and instance variables.
   Local variables in Ruby are variables that are defined within a method or a block. They are confined to the scope in which they are declared and are not accessible outside of it.
   This means that if you define a local variable inside a method, it cannot be accessed outside of that method.
   On the other hand, instance variables, denoted with an '@' prefix, belong to a specific instance of a class. They enable data persistence and access across different methods within that instance. This means that the value of an instance variable persists as long as the object instance exists.

Q 2.Difference between local and global variables ?
   local variable:
   accessible only within the method,block, or class/module where it is defined.
   starts with a lowercase letter or underscore (e.g., name_value)
   global variable:
   accessible from anywhere in the program.
   starts with a dollar sign ($) (e.g, $value).
