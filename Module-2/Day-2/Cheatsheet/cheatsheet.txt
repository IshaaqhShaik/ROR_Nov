Differentiate between local variables and instance variables.

Local variables in Ruby are variables that are defined within a method or a block. They are confined to the scope in which they are declared and are not accessible outside of it. This means that if you define a local variable inside a method, it cannot be accessed outside of that method.

On the other hand, instance variables, denoted with an '@' prefix, belong to a specific instance of a class. They enable data persistence and access across different methods within that instance. This means that the value of an instance variable persists as long as the object instance exists.
