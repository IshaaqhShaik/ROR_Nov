difference between local and global variables ?
   local variable:
      accessible only within the method,block, or class/module where it is defined.
      starts with a lowercase letter or underscore (e.g., name_value)
   global variable:
      accessible from anywhere in the program.
      starts with a dollar sign ($) (e.g, $value).

What is difference between "puts" and "print" ?

  In ruby both puts and print are used to output data to the console they behave slightly different.
  
   Puts : Outputs the data you give it followed by a newline character (\n), which moves the cursor to next line.
         This means that every call to puts will begin on a new line.

   Print : print outputs the data you give it exactly as is, without adding a newline character.
