difference between local and global variables ?

 local variable:

   accessible only within the method,block, or class/module where it is defined.

   starts with a lowercase letter or underscore (e.g., name_value)

global variable:

   accessible from anywhere in the program.

   starts with a dollar sign ($) (e.g, $value).
