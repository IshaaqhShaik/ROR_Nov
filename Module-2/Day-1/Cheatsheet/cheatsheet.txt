1.How to create ruby programs?
     Use any text editor and create a hello.rb file.

2. What is difference between "puts" and "print" ?

     In ruby both puts and print are used to output data to the console they behave slightly different.
  
     Puts : Outputs the data you give it followed by a newline character (\n), which moves the cursor to next line.
         This means that every call to puts will begin on a new line.

     Print : print outputs the data you give it exactly as is, without adding a newline character.

What is gets.chomp?
  gets is used to capture user input as a string ,including the newline character.
  While chomp is used to remove the trailing newline character from that string.
  Using both methods together is a common practise when working with user input in Ruby to ensure that the input is in a clean and usable format.
