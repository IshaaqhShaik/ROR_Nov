 What is difference between "puts" and "print" ?

  In ruby both puts and print are used to output data to the console they behave slightly different.

  Puts : Outputs the data you give it followed by a newline character (\n), which moves the cursor to next line.
         This means that every call to puts will begin on a new line.

 Print : print outputs the data you give it exactly as is, without adding a newline character.
