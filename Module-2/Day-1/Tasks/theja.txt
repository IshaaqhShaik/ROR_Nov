Ruby Programming
->Design History of Ruby
  it is developed by Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto in Japan in the year 1993

->Static typed language
  The static typed language of a variable determined at compile time and cannot change during runtime,the compiler will fail to compile until any errors are fixed.

->Dynamic typed language
  The Dynamic typed language of a variable is determined at runtime meaning that variables can change types as the program runs.The program can compile even if it contains errors.

The main difference between Static and Dynamic typing is when a Programming determines the type of a variable

->Object oriented program(OOPS)
  Every element is treated as Object.

->Extensive functional Programming
  To grasping the code

->Scripting language
  Used for miner and major Programming,and basic read and write operations will work

->More Human Oriented than any other programming language.

Key features of Ruby
->Simplicity and efficiency
  It allows developers to do a lot if work with a few lines of code

->Flexibility
  It is interpreted language.It's a Programming language that executes instructions directly,line by line,without the need to compile yhe code in to machine language first.
  ex:Java Script,Ruby,Perl,PHP
  Compiled language is a Programming language that is converted in to machine code so that the processor can execute it.The Compiled languages are Compiled not interpreted.
  ex:c,c++

The main difference between interpreted and Compiled languages is that languages are translated in to machine code before execution,while interpreted languages are executed directly.

->Object-oriented Programming
  Ruby is built around Objects,which are self-contained modules of code that bundle behavier and state.

->Dynamic typing and Duck typing
  Ruby supports both Dynamic and Duck typing.

->Readable syntax
  Ruby has a flexible syntax,that's easy to read.

->Meta Programming
  Ruby supports Metaprogramming,which allows code to manipulate itself and code.

Agile manifesto
->Language should encourage readability.
->Language should be expresive to developers.
->Language should enbrace changes and Dynamic.
->Language Design should focus on users.

Installing Ruby in Windows.OOPS
  Ruby can be installed using "RubyInstaller.exe" and executable file from ruby installer.org

Interactive Ruby
  Once done with the Installation we can access the "Interactive Ruby"environment,where we can play around with Ruby Programming language in local.

How to create and execute ruby programs
->Use any text editer and create a name.rb file
->Run the following command ruby filename.rb

Basic commands
->Print text using puts
  puts"please enter your age"

->Accept user input using gets
  age = gets.

->Format user input using chomp method
  age = gets.chomp()

->Comments to add what your code does
  #p "Below line gets the input from the user"
