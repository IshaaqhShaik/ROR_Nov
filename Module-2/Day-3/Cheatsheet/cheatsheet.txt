What is logical operator in ruby and explain types ?

  They are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration.

  Logical AND(&&) - operator returns true when both the conditions in consideration are satisfied. Otherwise it returns false. 
                    Using “and” is an alternate for && operator.
 
  Logical OR(||)  - operator returns true when one (or both) of the conditions in consideration is satisfied. 
                    Otherwise it returns false. Using “or” is an alternate for || operator.

  Logical NOT(!)  - operator returns true the condition in consideration is not satisfied. Otherwise it returns false. Using “not” is an alternate for ! operator.
