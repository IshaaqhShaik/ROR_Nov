Task-1:
    Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

    The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

    Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

Task-2:
    An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

    In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

    For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

    Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

    For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

    P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

Task-3: 

    Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.

Task-4:

    Use for loop to print the following pattern.
