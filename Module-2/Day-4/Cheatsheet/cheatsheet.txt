1.Explain case statement in Ruby.
    In Ruby, we use 'case' instead of 'switch' and 'when' instead of 'case'.
    The case statement matches one statement with multiple conditions just like a switch statement in other languages.

2.Explain the usage of the 'if' statement in Ruby?
    The if statement in Ruby is used for conditional branching in code. 
    It evaluates a condition and, if the condition is true, it executes a block of code.
